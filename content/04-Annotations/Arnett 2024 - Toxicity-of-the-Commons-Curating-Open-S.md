## Annotation

Open-source pre-training data is increasingly treated as a shared resource for building “open” language models, yet it can embed and reproduce harmful speech patterns at scale. Arnett, Jones, Yamshchikov, and Langlais argue that reducing toxic model behavior requires intervening upstream in data, and they focus specifically on the distinctive constraints of public-domain corpora (including historical documents and OCR-derived text) where standard web-text toxicity filters can be impractical or ill-suited. They propose a fully open-source curation pipeline designed for these conditions and present three concrete contributions: (1) ToxicCommons, a custom-labeled dataset organized across five toxicity dimensions (racial/origin-based, gender/sex-based, religious, ability-based discrimination, and violence); (2) Celadon, a classifier trained on that dataset to detect toxic content more efficiently at scale in open data; and (3) a “balanced” filtration strategy that explicitly trades off safety filtering against retaining sufficient training material. The paper’s core claim is that open-data model development needs domain-attuned, auditable curation methods paired with task-specific classifiers, so that openness in data does not automatically translate into avoidable harms in downstream model outputs.
